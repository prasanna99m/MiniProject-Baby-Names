# MiniProject-Baby-Names
Hi all,
This was my mini project for a 4 week course on Coursera : "Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software" by Duke University.
This project is about analyzing and processing the data from CSV files using Java.  
I have included the project guide in the file "MiniProject Exercise Guide.pdf".
You can find the java code in the file "babyNames.java".
The test files can be downloaded from "Test Files.rar".
